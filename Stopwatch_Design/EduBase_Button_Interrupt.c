 * @brief Source code for the EduBase_Button_Interrupt driver.
 *
 * This file contains the function definitions for the EduBase_Button_Interrupt driver.
 * It interfaces with the EduBase Board push buttons. The following pins are used:
 *	- SW2 (PD3)
 *	- SW3 (PD2)
 *
 * It configures the pins to trigger interrupts on rising edges. The EduBase Board 
 * push buttons operate in an active high configuration.
